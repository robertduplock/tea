# Tea Time(r)

A simple, responsive node.js app designed to help people make the perfect cup of tea.

Uses Bootstrap (CSS only) and Express. Otherwise it is written in pure OO Javascript.

Tea data is collected via an async xhr request (no jQuery required!) to a local *.json file.

## TODO
1. Improve overall layout & colour scheme
2. Add (optional) browser alert when tea is done
3. Add button to mute sound
