# Tea Time(r)

A simple, responsive node.js app designed to help people make the perfect cup of tea.

Uses Bootstrap and Express. Otherwise it is written in pure OO Javascript.
Tea data is collected via a RESTful api.

### Currently a work in progress - please check back again soon for heaps of improvements!

## TODO
1. Improve overall layout & colour scheme
2. Keep tea type highlighted on click
3. Add (optional) sound when tea is done
4. Add (optional) browser alert when tea is done
5. Allow user to choose between celsius & fahrenheit
6. BUG-FIX: Sometimes timer digits do not reset once timer is up
